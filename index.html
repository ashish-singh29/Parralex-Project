           <p class="text">Adventure fills in thrill in our lives. There are many ways to indulge in adventure. 
               <br> <br>Adventure trips are all about making memories, gaining more knowledge, learning new things about the surroundings and about one’s own self and making lots of great stories. Going for an adventure camp is the best way to get all of these as it forces one to get out of their ordinary lives and try new things.

           <p class="text">Cycling helps us in improving the muscles. The regular cycling exercise strengthens the bones located in legs, hands, and other body parts that have direct involvement in cycling. When we start pedaling our legs get involved in this activity. The continuous pedaling makes our legs stronger. 
              <br> <br>Cycling – its pleasures and advantages can also include some other factors. When we move on cycle to certain place, we find occasion to understand the olden times and natural features of that place. We can admit the fact that the one who uses cycle is richer than the one who uses a car.

               </div>
               <p class="text">Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a harness or lies supine in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside. 
                  <br> <br>Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to two hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

                <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2> 
             </div>
               <p class="text">Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools. 
                  <br> <br>The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.
